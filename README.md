## 6. Modeling Options
### 1. Collaborative Filtering
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**
  - **Description:** Recommends items by finding similar users and suggesting items they liked.
  - **Algorithm Example:** k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
  - **Pros:** Effective if you have a lot of users with overlapping preferences.
  - **Cons:** May struggle with sparse data; computationally intensive with large user bases.

- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**
  - **Description:** Recommends items by finding similar items and suggesting those similar to items the user has liked.
  - **Algorithm Example:** Cosine Similarity, Pearson Correlation.
  - **Pros:** Often more stable than user-based as items typically have more consistent patterns than users.
  - **Cons:** Requires sufficient item overlap across users to be effective.

### 2. Matrix Factorization
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
  - **Description:** Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors representing users and items.
  - **Algorithm Example:** SVD, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for SVD.
  - **Pros:** Can handle sparsity well; effective for discovering latent factors.
  - **Cons:** Can overfit with small datasets; typically requires more data to perform well.

- **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**
  - **Description:** Factorizes the user-item interaction matrix with non-negativity constraints.
  - **Algorithm Example:** NMF with coordinate descent or multiplicative update rules.
  - **Pros:** Useful for interpretability since factors are non-negative; can handle sparsity.
  - **Cons:** Similar limitations to SVD regarding overfitting on small datasets.

### 3. Deep Learning-Based Models

  - **Cons:** Data-hungry; can easily overfit with small datasets.

- **Autoencoders**
  - **Description:** Uses encoder-decoder architectures to learn compressed representations of users and items.
  - **Algorithm Example:** Denoising Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders.
  - **Pros:** Can learn compact representations and work well for denoising.
  - **Cons:** Requires a significant amount of data; might overfit on small datasets.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
  - **Description:** Models sequential user behavior over time.
  - **Algorithm Example:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs).
  - **Pros:** Good for sequential data and capturing temporal patterns.
  - **Cons:** Computationally intensive; requires a large amount of data.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
  - **Description:** Extracts spatial features from user-item interaction data.
  - **Algorithm Example:** CNN-based recommendation models.
  - **Pros:** Effective for spatial data and extracting local patterns.

### 5. Content-Based Filtering
- **Description:** Recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest in, based on item features.
- **Algorithm Example:** TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec for text data.
- **Pros:** Effective with small datasets as it relies on item features; less prone to cold start problems.
